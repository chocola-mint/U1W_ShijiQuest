# Freeheart

## About
Freeheart is a game framework for Unity, primarily used for game jams, but also small projects in general.

Since this is mostly a personal framework, backward-compatibility will not be a focus. Expect API-breaking changes across versions.

## Features

* A UI system designed to support transitions easily, allowing mix-mash of different approaches such as Unity Animations and tweening.
* [YarnSpinner](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner-Unity) extensions.
