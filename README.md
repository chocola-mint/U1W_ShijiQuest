# シジ・クエスト (SHIJI Quest)

## About
Entry for the [unity1week game jam](https://unityroom.com/unity1weeks/58). You can play it [here](https://unityroom.com/games/shijiquest).

This project is notable for its experimental use of Visual Scripting with C#. Visual Scripting's "intended usage", as one might say.

## Notes
* This project uses the Localization package, which depends on Addressables, and so I was forced to host the StreamingAssets folder on [another GitHub repository](https://github.com/chocola-mint/ShijiQuest_Bucket).
* This project is a hard fork of my game jam template, [Freeheart](https://github.com/chocola-mint/Freeheart). Though it doesn't actually use any of Freeheart's features. ~~Oops.~~
* Notable state machines:
  * Game (Scene) > Scene Setup > Game Canvas
  * Akariusagi (Prefab)
